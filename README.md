# Breast Cancer Cluster Analysis and PCA. 

In this paper, I conducted two unsupervised method, cluster analysis and principal of components analysis on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set. The main objective is to determine the characteristics of the cell nuclei that are unique to malignant breast tumors and benign beast tumor. I then used a log normal probabilistic model for the most important variable obtained from the analysis. The data used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which contains characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The data set can be assesed via https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic) .
